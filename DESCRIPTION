Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    Offers the Interval-Censored Sequence Kernel Association (ICSKAT) test for set-based inference in genetic association studies. Interval-censored data occur for time-to-event data when the event time is not known exactly but can be deduced to fall within a given interval. For example, some medical conditions like bone mineral density deficiency are generally only diagnosed at formal medical checkups. If a patient goes for checkups yearly and is diagnosed at, say, age 30, then the onset of the deficiency is only known to fall between the date of their age 29 checkup and the date of the age 30 checkup. Interval-censored data include right- and left-censored data as special cases. ICSKAT can test for the association between a set of genetic variants (like all single nucleotide polymorphisms located in a gene) and a time-to-event outcome that is subject to interval censoring. This package also provides the interval-censored Burden test and the ICSKATO test, which is the optimal combination of the ICSKAT and Burden tests. Please see the vignette for a quickstart guide.
